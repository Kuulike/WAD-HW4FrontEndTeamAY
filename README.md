## Project setup
### Front-end
To set up and run the front-end navigate to the directory 'hwvue' and install the necessary dependencies.
```
cd .\hwvue\
npm install
```
### Back-end
To set up and run the back-end navigate to the directory 'backend' and install the necessary dependencies.
```
cd .\backend\
npm install
```
The backend also needs an existing database and access credentials to function. By default the used database is named 'testWad'.
Edit the 'database.js' file to have the right credentials to access the database by inserting the correct password and port number.

## Running the project
### Front-end
Make sure the back-end is up and running. Navigate to the front-end project directory and run the app.
```
cd .\hwvue\
npm run serve
```
### Back-end
Make sure the database credentials are correct in the 'database.js' file. Navigate to the back-end project directory and run the app. 
```
cd .\backend\
npm start
```
